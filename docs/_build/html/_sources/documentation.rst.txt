===========================
VoigtFit Parameter Language
===========================

.. role:: red
.. role:: gray

.. include:: <isonum.txt>


.. todo:

   - If HI is included in the lines to be fitted, the metallicity will automatically be calculated.
   - more detailed options available for the minimization and output.
   - more molecular data to be included.

The program can be run directly from terminal using a parameter input file to tell VoigtFit
what to do::

  %] VoigtFit  input_filename

The parameter file consists of a set of easy to read *statements* that define
things such as the data to fit, atomic or molecular transitions, or the component structure.
All the statements are meant to be relatively intuitive and can be written rather freely in
the so-called VoigtFit parameter language.

This language allows the user to define parameters without using python scripting
which has a slightly more complex syntax. There are a few general rules for the parameter language:

  Everything that comes after a `#` sign is regarded as a comment and is not parsed.

  The number of spaces in a given line between parameters and values is not important.

  The order of the statements is not important either. This will be handled by the program
  at runtime, so you can freely arrange the parameter file as you see fit.

  All optional arguments below are stated in square brackets.

  Double underscores below indicate an optional keyword argument to be given by the user.


.. note::

  A parameter file template can be created in your working directory
  by running ``VoigtFit`` with no arguments.



Many of the statements are optional, but there is a subset of statements that
must be present in the file.
If these are not present in the parameter file, or if their values are
not understood, the program will cause an error.
A minimal working example of all the mandatory statements looks something like this:

  Mandatory Statements:

  .. parsed-literal::

    name_ : test_dataset
    `z_sys`_ : 1.985
    data_  'this_spectrum.tab'  35.
    lines_  FeII_2374
    component_  FeII  -10.5   10.0  14.5  velocity
    component_  FeII    0.0   15.0  13.5  velocity

This is all you need to get started. The rest is an interactive and iterative process,
which VoigtFit makes easy for you.

All the available statements that can be included (and parsed) in the parameter file
are presented in detail below. For a quick overview of available statements look in the
table of contents.

A set of predefined input parameter files are available in the *test_data* folder on github_.


.. _component: `add components`_

.. _github: https://github.com/jkrogager/VoigtFit

Name
----

**name :  dataset_name**

  *dataset_name* gives the name of the dataset.
  The dataset is automatically saved (as ``dataset_name.hdf5``),
  and if a dataset of the given name is present in the working directory,
  it will be loaded automatically. The current dataset can be overwritten
  by running VoigtFit with the option ``-f``.


Save
----

**save : [ filename ]**

  *filename* is the filename used for the graphic output and for parameter output.
  If no filename is given, the dataset `name` attribute will be used.
  The graphic output will be saved in pdf format and the parameter files will be saved as ascii files:
  The best-fit parameters will be saved to `filename.fit` and the best-fit continuum parameters
  will be saved to `filename`.cont.


z_sys
-----

**z_sys :  z_sys**

  *z_sys* gives the systemic redshift of the absorption system.
  Relative velocities are calculated with respect to this redshift.


Data
----

**data  filename  resolution  [ norm   air  nsub=1  ext=None]**

  *filename* specifies the path to the spectrum
  The file should be an ASCII table with up to four columns: wavelength, flux, error, mask
  separated by blank spaces or a FITS file. See documentation of `fitsutil <https://github.com/jkrogager/fitsutil>`_
  for details about allowed FITS extensions and formats.

  *resolution*	is the spectral resolution of the given spectrum in units of km/s.
  Alternatively, the resolution can be given as a string pointing to a file
  containing the line-spread function (LSF) for the given spectrum. The file
  format should follow that laid out by the `HST/COS instrument
  <http://www.stsci.edu/hst/cos/performance/spectral_resolution/>`_.
  The first line gives wavelength in Angstrom and the column below
  each given wavelength defines the kernel in pixel space:

  +----------------+----------------+----------------+--------+----------------+
  | wl\ :sub:`1`   | wl\ :sub:`2`   | wl\ :sub:`3`   |  ...   | wl\ :sub:`N`   |

  | lsf\ :sub:`11` | lsf\ :sub:`21` | lsf\ :sub:`31` |  ...   | lsf\ :sub:`N1` |
  +----------------+----------------+----------------+--------+----------------+
  | lsf\ :sub:`12` | lsf\ :sub:`22` | lsf\ :sub:`32` |  ...   | lsf\ :sub:`N2` |

  +----------------+----------------+----------------+--------+----------------+


.. |ve|     unicode:: U+22EE .. VERTICAL ELLIPSIS
.. |drde|   unicode:: U+22F1 .. DOWN RIGHT DIAGONAL ELLIPSIS


Optional arguments:

  *norm* : if present in the line, this indicates that the spectrum in filename are normalized.

  *air* : if present, the wavelengths in the spectrum will be converted from air to vacuum.

  *nsub=1* : use this keyword to set the subsampling factor of the kernel given in the LSF file.
  The default value is 1, i.e., assuming that the sampling of the kernel matches the sampling of the data.
  If no LSF file is given as *res* then the keyword will be ignored.

  *ext=None* : use this keyword to define which extension to use if there are several data extensions
  in the input FITS file. This is only relevant for FITS Table data. The extension can be given as the integer
  index or the extension name.

.. topic:: Example

  ``data  'J2350-0052_uvb.tab'  40.  air``

    This will load the data from the file named ‘J2350-0052_uvb.tab’,
    convert the wavelength column from air to vacuum, and assign
    a spectral resolution of 40 km/s.

  ``data  "norm_data/norm_2350-0052_vis.tab"  'lsf_file.dat'  norm  nsub=3``

    This will load the data from the file named 'norm_2350-0052_vis.tab'
    in the directory ‘norm_data’ and assign a wavelength dependent line spread function
    as given in the file 'lsf_file.dat'.
    The keyword `norm` is present, so the data will be marked as normalized,
    and no interactive normalization will therefore pop up during data preparation.
    The keyword `nsub` is set to 3, stating that the kernels provided in the LSF file
    are subsampled by a factor of three relative to the data.

  ``data  'sdss_spectrum.fits'  150.  ext=4``

    This will load the data from the extension no. 4 of the file named 'sdss_spectrum.fits':

    .. code-block:: text

        No.    Name      Ver    Type      Cards   Dimensions   Format

Lines
-----

**lines  line_tags  [ velspan=__ ]**

  *line_tags* can be a single line or multiple lines separated by blank spaces.
  The line tag should match a line in the line-list, e.g., FeII_2374, SiII_1526,
  or HI_1215. For the Lyman series of hydrogen and deuterium, the following
  notation is also accepted: HI_1 for the Ly-alpha, HI_3 for Ly-gamma, and so on.


Optinal arguments:

  *velspan* : the value after the equal-sign is taken as the velocity
  span in km/s around each line to be defined as a fitting region.
  The default span is 500 km/s.


.. topic:: Example

  ``lines  FeII_2260  FeII_2374  SiII_1808  HI_1215``

    This will define the two singly ionized iron transitions at 2260 and 2374Å
    together with the singly ionized silicon transition at 1808Å and the Ly-alpha line.

  ``lines FeII_2374  SiII_1808``

    This will define the iron and silicon lines with default velocity spans.

  ``lines HI_1  HI_2  velspan=5000``

    This will define the Ly-α and Ly-β lines with a larger 5000 km/s velocity span.


Fine-structure Lines
--------------------

**fine-lines  ground_state  [ levels  velspan=__ ]**

  *ground_state* refers to the line identifier for the ground state transition
  of the line complex, e.g., 'CI_1656'.

  This statement, if present in the parameter file, will define all the corresponding
  transitions for the given levels of related to the given ground state. At the moment,
  these line complexes are only defined for neutral carbon (CI) and its two fine-structure
  levels.


Optional arguments:

  *levels* : indicates which excited fine-structure levels to include.
  This should be given as a space separated list of letters: 'a' for the first excited level (J=1),
  'b' for the second excited level (J=2), etc.
  By default, all fine-structure levels will be included.

  *velspan* : the value after the equal-sign is taken as the velocity
  span in km/s around each line to be defined as a fitting region.
  The default span is 500 km/s.


.. topic:: Example

  ``fine-lines  CI_1560``

    This will define all the transitions of CI, CI\ :sup:`*` and CI\ :sup:`**` related to the
    ground state of the 2s\ :sup:`2` 2p\ :sup:`2`  :sup:`3`\ P |rarr|
    2s 2p\ :sup:`3`  :sup:`3`\ D line complex at 1560 Å.

  ``fine-lines  CI_1328  a``

    This will only define the transitions of the ground state and the first excited
    fine-structure level (*J=1*) of the 2s\ :sup:`2` 2p\ :sup:`2`  :sup:`3`\ P |rarr|
    2s 2p\ :sup:`3`  :sup:`3`\ P line complex at 1328 Å.

|

.. important::
  :class: red

  Components have to be defined manually for the fine-structure levels.
  For this case, the *ion* to reference for the excited levels is the ground state ion
  (in the example above 'CI') with the lower case letter to designate the level, see the
  optional argument *levels*. So for the first fine-structure level of 'CI' the *ion*
  would be 'CIa'.

  For more details, see the section `add components`_ below.


Add Molecules
-------------

**molecule  element  bands  [ J=__  velspan=__ ]**

  *element* refers to the molecule to be fitted, for now only CO and H2 are defined
  in the database.

  *bands* designates a list of vibrational bands for the given molecule.
    For CO: the A(ν) |rarr| X(0) bands for ν up to ν=11, the C(0) |rarr| X(0) band, the d(5) |rarr| X(0)
    and e(1) |rarr| X(0). The bands are referred to as 'AX(ν-0)', 'CX(0-0)', 'dX(5-0)', and 'eX(1-0)'.

    For H\ :sub:`2`: the Lyman bands B(ν) |rarr| X(0) for ν up to ν=19 and Werner bands
    C(ν) |rarr| X(0) for ν up to ν=5. The Lyman and Werner bands are referred to as
    'BX(ν-0)' and 'CX(ν-0)', respectively.


Optional arguments:

  *J* : the upper rotational level to include for the given bands.
  All rotational levels from *J=0* up to (and including) *J* will be included.
  For CO the maximum *J* level included in the database is *J=4*, for H\ :sub:`2` this is *J=7*.
  The default value is *J=1*.

  *velspan* : the value after the equal-sign is taken as the velocity
  span in km/s around each line to be defined as a fitting region.
  The default span is 500 km/s.

.. topic:: Example

  ``molecule H2  BX(0-0)  BX(1-0)  BX(2-0)  J=5``

    This will define the rotational levels up to *J=5* for the three lowest vibrational
    Lyman bands of H\ :sub:`2`.

  ``molecule CO  AX(0-0)  AX(1-0)  J=4  velspan=120``

    This will define the rotational levels up to *J=4* for the two lowest vibrational bands of CO.


Add Components
--------------

**component  ion  z  b  logN  [ var_z=True/False  var_b=True/False  var_N=True/False
tie_z=__  tie_b=__  tie_N=__  velocity  thermal]**

alt.: component  ion  z=__  b=__  logN=__  [ var_z=True/False  var_b=True/False  var_N=True/False
tie_z=__  tie_b=__  tie_N=__  velocity  thermal]

  *ion* specifies for which ion the component should be defined, e.g., FeII, SiII.

  *z* gives the redshift of the component.

  *b* gives the broadening parameter of the given component.

  *logN* gives the 10-base logarithm of the column density for the given component in cm\ :sup:`-2`.

  Note: The order of the values of z, b, logN must be followed, unless the are given
  as keyword arguments, i.e., logN=__  z=__  b=__


Optional arguments:

  Parameters which should be kept fixed can be set by the optional arguments *var_z* for redshift,
  *var_b* for broadening parameter, and *var_N* for column density.
  These are passed as keyword values which are either *True* or *False*, the default is *True*.

  Parameters for different components and ions can be tied to each other using the
  *tie_z*, *tie_b*, *tie_N* options. This is mostly used to tie redshifts or broadening parameters
  for different species.
  The parameters are tied using the following naming convention:
  the name of a given parameter is made up by the *base* (which is either ‘z’, ‘b’, or ‘logN’),
  the component *number* (starting from 0), and the *ion* (e.g., FeII).
  The *base* and *number* are joined together with no spaces in between,
  and the *ion* is appended with an underscore (‘_’) as in between; e.g., 'z0_FeII' for the first
  component of FeII.

  *velocity* : if this keyword is included, the first argument (or z=) will be interpreted
  as a velocity offset relative to *z_sys*.

  *thermal* : if this keyword is present, the given parameter will be tied to a
  `thermal broadening model`_.

.. _thermal broadening model: `thermal model`_


.. topic:: Example

  ``component  FeII  1.957643  7.0  14.5  var_z=False``

    This will define a component for FeII at z=1.957643 with *b* = 7.0 km/s and a column density
    of 10\ :sup:`14.5` cm\ :sup:`-2`. The redshift will no be varied during the fit.

  ``component  SiII  -109.5  7.0  16.0  tie_b='b0_FeII' velocity``

    This will define a component for SiII at a relative velocity of -109.5 km/s
    with *b* = 7.0 km/s and a column density 10\ :sup:`16.0`.
    The *b*-parameter will be tied to the first component defined for *FeII*.



Interactive Components
----------------------

**interactive  line_tags**

  *line_tags* can be a single line or multiple lines separated by blank spaces or commas.
  The line tag should match a line in the line-list, e.g., FeII_2374, SiII_1526.
  The line tag must be defined in the dataset (using the ``lines`` statement).

This command will activate the interactive window for defining components for the given lines.
Notice that this will overwrite any other components defined previously for this element.


**interactive_view : velocity  [ or wavelength ]**

  The *interactive_view* keyword specifies how the data will be displayed in the interactive window.
  If `velocity` or `vel` is given, the data will be displayed in velocity space relative
  to the systemic redshift. Otherwise, if `wavelength` or `wave` is given, the data are
  displayed in observed wavelength space -- this is the default view.


.. topic:: Example

  The interactive definition of components will bring up the following graphic display:

  .. image:: figs/comp1.png
      :width: 48%
  .. image:: figs/comp2.png
      :width: 48%

  If the data are already normalized, the first window will ask you to simply mark the location
  of components you want to add by clicking with the cursor (left panel).
  Otherwise, you will first be prompted to mark the continuum level (in order to estimate
  the initial column density estimate).
  You should select both the desired location and depth of the component, as this will
  allow the code to calculate a realistic starting value based on the resolution of the data.
  This will make it easier for the code to converge (especially if many components are present).
  The positions you select will progressively show up as red crosses (right panel) as you mark them.
  When you have selected the number of components you want to fit, press *enter*
  and return to the terminal to save the components.



Copy Components
---------------

**copy components from ion1 to ion2  [ (scale  logN  ref_comp)  tie_z=True/False  tie_b=True/False ]**

  *ion1* denotes the *ion* from which to copy components (FeII, CI, etc.).
  Components must manually be defined for this ion.

  *ion2* denotes the *ion* to which the components will be copied.
  Lines must be defined for this *ion* using a ``lines`` statement.

  Note -- The order is not important. This is inferred from the position of the words *to* and *from*.
          If components are also defined using the regular `component` statement
          then both the copied components and the individual components are included in the fit!


Optinal arguments:

  *scale* : this keyword activates a relative scaling of the pattern of column densities
  from the input ion (*ion1*) to the destination ion (*ion2*).
  The keyword takes two arguments:
    *logN* : the desired column density for the reference component

    *ref_comp* : the number of the reference component (starting from 0).

    *Note -- The default scaling is set to Solar relative abundances for the two elements.*

  *tie_z* : If *True*, all redshifts for *ion2* will be tied to those of *ion1*.
  Default is *True*.

  *tie_b* : If *True*, all *b*-parameters for *ion2* will be tied to those of *ion1*.
  Default is *True*.

.. topic:: Example

  ``copy components from FeII to SiII  scale 15.3  1``
    This will copy the component structure defined for FeII to SiII
    and the logarithm of the column density of the 2nd component will be set to 15.3
    while keeping the relative abundance pattern as defined for FeII.

  ``copy components to CII from FeII  tie_b=False``
    This will copy components already defined for FeII to CII,
    however, the broadening parameters are not fixed to those of FeII.
    The initial value for log(N) for CII will be set using the Solar
    relative abundance of carbon and iron.


Delete Components
-----------------

**delete component  number  [from] ion**

  *number* gives the number of the component to delete (starting from 0).

  *ion* gives the ion from which to delete the given component.

  Note -- the word 'from' before the ion is optional.

This function is useful for removing components that were defined using a `copy components`_
statement, if not all components for the new ion should be fitted.
For components defined via the explicit component statement,
a component can simply be commented out (using ‘#’) to delete it from the fit.


.. topic:: Example

  Suppose that FeII has 5 components defined and the same component structure has been copied to
  ZnII; However, the zinc lines are much weaker and therefore only the 4 strongest components can be
  constrained for ZnII. This would be defined as follows:

    | ``component FeII  2.0456  15.5  14.6``
    | ``component FeII  2.0469  11.5  14.8``
    | ``component FeII  2.0482  17.5  13.3``
    | ``component FeII  2.0489  14.0  14.3``
    | ``component FeII  2.0495  13.5  14.7``

    | ``copy components from FeII to ZnII  scale 13.2  0``
    | ``delete component 2 from ZnII``


Continuum Normalization
-----------------------

Unless the input data have already been normalized (use the *norm* keyword in the data_ statement),
the user can use one of the following two methods to normalize the fitting regions before fitting.


**norm_method :  linear  [ or  spline ]**

  The *norm_method* specifies how to manually normalize the fitting regions.
  Before fitting, an interactive window will pop up for each fitting region.
  It must be either '*linear*' or '*spline*'. The default is 'linear'

  If *norm_method* is set to '*linear*', the user must specify a continuum region
  on either side of the absorption line (by clicking on the left and right boundaries
  of the continuum region).
  The continuum is then fitted using a straight line fit.

  If *norm_method* is set to '*spline*', the user can select a range of points for each
  fitting region. The points will then be fitted with a 3\ :sup:`rd` order spline
  in order to create a continuum model.


**norm_view : velocity  [ or wavelength ]**

  The *norm_view* keyword specifies how the data will be displayed in the interactive window.
  If `velocity` or `vel` is given, the data will be displayed in velocity space relative
  to the systemic redshift. Otherwise, if `wavelength` or `wave` is given, the data are
  displayed in observed wavelength space -- this is the default view.


**C_order = order**

  *order* is the highest order of Chebyshev_ polynomials to include in the continuum model.
  All orders from 0 up to *order* will be included.

This statement indicates the maximum order of Chebyshev_ polynomials to include
for the continuum model. The continuum model is automatically optimized together with
the line fitting.
By giving a negative order, the code will ask to manually normalize the fitting regions
using the specified *norm_method* (see above).

The default is -1, i.e., no Chebyshev_ model is used.


.. topic:: Example

  The interactive normalization selected through *norm_method* = 'linear' will open
  the following window prompting you to select a region on the left and right hand side
  of the absorption line. The continuum will then be fitted as a straight line.

    .. image:: figs/norm1.png
        :width: 48%
    .. image:: figs/norm2.png
        :width: 48%

  The left panel shows the window which pops up asking for a selection of continnuum regions.
  You have to select a left and right boundary on the *left* hand side of the absorption line
  by clicking with the cursor at the position in the plot. The first selected point will show up
  as a red cross. If you make a mistake you can remove a red cross by right-clicking.
  After the first two boundaries have been selected, you have to repeat the selection on the
  *right* hand side of the absorption profile.
  Afterwards, the fitting region will be normalized and the normalized region will show in
  the interactive window (right panel). Then you have to acknowledge that the normalization
  was done correctly by pressing *enter* in the terminal. If you want to redo the normalization,
  type *no* or *n* in the terminal and press *enter*. This will bring you back to the beginning.

.. _Chebyshev: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials


Mask
----

**mask  [ line_tags ]  [ force ]**

Optional arguments:

  *line_tags* : either a single line identifier (e.g., 'FeII_2374') or a space separated list
  of identifiers for which to run the interactive masking procedure.
  Default is to define masks for all lines.

  *force* : if present, the masking for the given line_tags will be reset everytime the user
  runs the fit. Otherwise the mask will only be defined the first time the dataset is fitted
  and the subsequent runs will load the mask from the previous generation unless the dataset
  file (.hdf5) is deleted or reset using the `-f` option of `VoigtFit`.

This statement allows the user to define mask interactively for all lines or individual lines.

Note -- The mask is an exclusion mask, so pixels that are defined in the mask, are *not* fitted.

.. topic:: Example

  If you have included a *mask* statement in the parameter file (either for all lines or only for
  selected lines), the following window will pop up:

  .. image :: figs/mask1.png
      :width: 48%
  .. image :: figs/mask2.png
      :width: 48%

  In the first window (left panel) you are prompted to mark left and right boundaries of
  regions that should **not** be included in the fit. You can mark as many regions as you want.
  The orange and red lines on top of the region indicates telluric emission and absorption templates,
  respectively. The thin red lines show the position of predefined components for the given ion.
  When you are done, or you want to update the view to see the masks you have defined, press *enter*.
  This will update the graph and show masked regions in :red:`red` (right panel).
  If you want to continue adding masks, type *no* in the terminal and add new masks.
  When you are done, type *yes* or simply press *enter* in the terminal. If you have made a mistake
  you can clear the masks by typing *c* or *clear* in the terminal.

    .. important::
      :class: red

      If an uneven number of points are selected, the masks will not be calculated and you
      have to start over. So if you are defining many masks (e.g., in the Lyman-α forest),
      it is advised to define the masks in several turns.


**mask_view : velocity  [ or wavelength ]**

  The *mask_view* keyword specifies how the data will be displayed in the interactive window.
  If `velocity` or `vel` is given, the data will be displayed in velocity space relative
  to the systemic redshift. Otherwise, if `wavelength` or `wave` is given, the data are
  displayed in observed wavelength space -- this is the default view.


Note -- The telluric template was obtained from ESOs `skycalc <http://www.eso.org/observing/etc/skycalc>`_.


Clear mask
----------

**clear mask**

If this statement is present in the parameter file, the masks for all fitting regions
will be reset before eventually defining new masks.



Total Column Densities
----------------------

**total**

When this statement is present in the parameter file, the total abundances summed
over all components for each ion will be printed to the terminal output.



Metallicity
-----------

**metallicity  logNHI  err_logNHI**

  *logNHI* gives the logarithm of the column density of neutral hydrogen in units of cm\ :sup:`-2`.

  *err_logNHI* gives the associated uncertainty on the logarithm of the column density of neutral hydrogen.

When this statement is present in the parameter file, the best-fit total abundances
for the defined ions in the dataset will be converted to metallicities for each ion,
that is, the abundance ratios of the given ions to neutral hydrogen relative to Solar abundances
from `Asplund et al. (2009) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2009ARA&A..47..481A/abstract>`_
are calculated.


Reset Fit Regions
-----------------

**reset  [ line_tags ]**

  This statement is deprecated and is no longer parsed by VoigtFit!


Resolution
----------

**resolution  res  [ line_tag ]**

  *res* gives the desired spectral resolution in km/s.

  Note -- this will change the resolution for *all* the loaded spectra.

Optional arguments:

  *line_tag* : specifies the line in a fitting region whose resolution should be changed.
  Default is all.


.. important::
  :class: red

  Changing the spectral resolution in the data_ statement will not update the spectral
  resolution in the fit, unless the dataset is deleted or overwritten (run ``VoigtFit -f``).


Change Systemic Redshift
------------------------

**systemic = value**

This statement defines how to update the systemic redshift after fitting.
Possible input for *value*:
  { *auto*, *none* or  [ *num* *ion* ] }

Default behavior is *none*: The systemic redshift will not be updated after fitting
and the redshift given through the `z_sys`_ statement will be used.

If systemic is set to *auto* the systemic redshift will be set to the redshift
of the strongest component. The element used to identify the strongest component
will be selected automatically, priority will be given to ions: ’SiII’ or ‘FeII’.
If none of these is present, the first line in the dataset will be used.

  :red:`Warning -- This may result in unexpected behavior.`

By giving an integer number (*num*) and an *ion*, the user can force the systemic redshift
to be set to the given component number of the given *ion* after the fit has converged.
The order of the arguments *num* and *ion* is not important.
Note that the components are 0-indexed, i.e., the first component is *num=0*.
If *num* is set to -1 then the last component of the given *ion* is used.

.. topic:: Example

  ``systemic = 2 FeII``

    this defines the systemic redshift as the 3rd component of FeII

  ``systemic = CI -1``

    this defines the systemic redshift as the last component of CI

  ``systemic = auto``

    If SiII is fitted, use strongest component of SiII, else if FeII is fitted use strongest FeII component.
    Lastly, if neither SiII nor FeII is used in the fit, use the first element defined in the dataset.


Thermal Model
-------------

**thermal  ions   T=__  turb=__ [ fix-T  fix-turb ]**

  *ions* is a list of space separated ions (e.g., SiII, CII, HI) to include in the
  thermal model. Absorption lines for all these ions must be defined using a lines_
  statement, and components for the given ions must be defined as well.

  *T* : this will give the intial guess for the temperature in Kelvins.

  *turb* : this will give the intial guess for the turbulent broadening in km/s.

Optional arguments:

  *fix-T* : if this keyword is present in the line, the temperature will not be varied.

  Note -- This will assume the same temperature for *all* components.

  *fix-turb* : if this keyword is present in the line, the turbulent broadening will
  not be varied.

  Note -- This will assume the same turbulent broadening for *all* components.

By default, all components of the given ions are assumed to be part of the thermal model.
If the user only wants to use a certain subset of components, then the given components
should be defined with the *thermal* keyword in the component_ statement.

.. topic:: Example

  | ``component  FeII  0.0  5.  14.5  velocity thermal``
  | ``component  FeII  10.  9.  15.2  velocity``
  | ``copy components from FeII to CII``
  | ``copy components from FeII to OI``
  |
  | ``thermal  FeII  CII  OI  T=500  turb=4.0``

    This will define a thermal model linking the broadening parameters of CII, OI and FeII
    in the first component only assuming an initial temperature of 500K
    and a turbulent broadening of 4.0 km/s.

    For more information, see the description of the :ref:`physical_model_results`.


Fit-Options
-----------

**fit-options   keyword=value**

  Set of *keyword* and *value* pairs that will be passed on to the lmfit_ minimizer.
  For a description of these, see the `minimize function`_ of lmfit_ or the documentation for
  `scipy.optimize.minimize`_ or `scipy.optimize.leastsq`_. By default the following parameters
  are set: ``ftol=0.01`` and ``factor=1.0``.

  Other acceptable keywords are:

    rebin=N

    where *N* refers to the rebinning factor used in the fit.

.. topic:: Example

  ``fit-options  rebin=2  method='nelder'``

    This will rebin the data by a factor of 2 and set the fitting method to Nelder--Mead optimization
    (instead of the default Levenberg--Marquardt).

  ``fit-option  ftol=0.001 rebin=2``

    This will set the tolerance for the convergence to 0.001 instead of 0.01 and rebin the data by a factor of 2.

Output
------

**output  individual-regions  velocity  individual-components**

The output statement takes two optional keywords:

  *individual-regions* : which saves the best-fit profile and data into individual files for
  all the fitting regions.

  *velocity* : which prints the best-fit parameters in terms of relative velocity
  instead of redshift. For the detailed behavior of this features, see the section on how to
  `change systemic redshift`_.

  *individual-components* : which saves the profiles of individual components of all lines
  that are defined. The profiles are calculated over the full wavelength range of the dataset.
  These are all saved as columns in a file with extension `.components`. Each component is
  identified by its ion and the component number, e.g., `FeII_0` for the first component
  of singly ionized iron (FeII).


Load
----

**load  fit_pars_filename**

  *fit_pars_filename* gives the filename of an output file from VoigtFit, containing the best-fit
  parameters from a previous fit. The components given in the file will be loaded to the
  current dataset.

  Note -- This will overwrite any existing components. However, additional components
  can be added by using the component_ statement.


Fix Velocity Structure
----------------------

**fix-velocity**

  If this keyword is present in the parameter file, then the velocity structure
  (i.e., the relative velocities and broadening parameters) of all elements
  is kept fixed.


Check-Lines
-----------

**check-lines  [f_lower=0  f_upper=100  l_lower=0  l_upper=1.e4]  [ignore]**

  If the keyword `ignore` appears in the command this will turn off the `check lines` functionality
  which prompts the user if other transitions for defined ions are available in the spectral coverage
  of the data.
  The user can filter the lines that will be prompted by setting the upper and lower limits on
  oscillator strength (f) or rest-frame wavelength (l) in Angstrom.

.. topic:: Example

  ``check-lines  ignore``

    this turns off the check lines function. The user will not be warned if other lines of already
    defined ions are available within the spectral data. Use this with caution unless you are very
    familiar with the atomic line list.

  ``check-lines  f_lower=0.001  l_lower=1200``

    this will only prompt the user if the missing lines have an oscillator strength larger than 0.001
    and a rest-frame wavelength larger than 1200 Angstrom.
